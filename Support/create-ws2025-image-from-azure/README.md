# Windows Server 2025 Image for Azure Stack Hub

Scripts to download a **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter** GEN1 VHD from the Azure Marketplace and register it as a platform image in **Azure Stack Hub**.

## Overview

Azure Stack Hub operators can use these scripts to manually obtain and import a Windows Server 2025 VM image.

```

| Step | Environment | What happens | Tools used |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **1** | Local machine | Installs the required PowerShell modules (`Az` 2020-09-01-hybrid profile, `AzureStack 2.4.0`). | `Install-Module` |
| **2** | Public Azure | Logs in via Azure CLI with device-code auth, then queries the Marketplace for the latest **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter Gen1** image URN (excluding Gen2 & Upgrade SKUs). | `az login`, `az vm image list` |
| **3** | Public Azure → Local | Creates a temporary **managed disk** from the Marketplace image, grants read access to obtain a SAS URL, and downloads the disk as a fixed-size VHD using **AzCopy v10**. Revokes disk access when done. | `az disk create`, `az disk grant-access`, AzCopy |
| **4** | Azure Stack Hub | Registers the Hub's Admin ARM endpoint as a PowerShell environment and authenticates as the **Service Admin**. | `Add-AzEnvironment`, `Connect-AzAccount` |
| **5** | Azure Stack Hub | Creates a resource group and storage account on the Hub, then uploads the local VHD using `Add-AzVhd`. | `New-AzStorageAccount`, `Add-AzVhd` |
| **6** | Azure Stack Hub | Registers the uploaded VHD as a **platform image** (publisher: `MicrosoftWindowsServer`, offer: `WindowsServer`, SKU: `2025-Datacenter`) and verifies it is available in the Hub Marketplace for tenant use. | `Add-AzsPlatformImage`, `Get-AzsPlatformImage` |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows (scripts use PowerShell 5.1+) |
| **Azure CLI** | Required for marketplace image discovery and disk operations. Install with `_Pre-req_Install_AzCLI.ps1`. |
| **Azure subscription** | Needed temporarily to create a managed disk from the marketplace image. |
| **Azure Stack Hub admin access** | Service Admin credentials and the Admin ARM endpoint. |
| **Disk space** | ~30 GB for the full-disk VHD, ~10 GB for small-disk. |
| **PowerShell modules** | Installed automatically by the script: `Az` (2020-09-01-hybrid profile), `AzureStack 2.4.0`. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Service Admin authentication (no MFA).**
> The script uses `Connect-AzAccount -Credential`, which **does not support MFA or Conditional Access**. Use a Service Admin account that is exempt from MFA, or modify Step 4 to use interactive `Connect-AzAccount -Environment $EnvironmentName -Tenant $TenantID` (drop `-Credential`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hub admin endpoint certificate must be trusted.**
> Step 4 calls `Invoke-RestMethod` against the Hub admin ARM endpoint. If that endpoint uses an internal CA / self-signed certificate that is not trusted on the workstation, the call will fail. Import the Hub's CA certificate into the workstation's Trusted Root store before running the script.

## Scripts

### `_Pre-req_Install_AzCLI.ps1`

Installs Azure CLI on Windows and adds it to the system PATH. Run this first if Azure CLI is not already installed.

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\_Pre-req_Install_AzCLI.ps1
```

### `Example_WS2025-create-image-from-Azure.ps1`

Main script that performs the full end-to-end workflow. **Before running**, open the script and update the parameters in the `PARAMETERS` section at the top:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `$AzureResourceGroup` | Temp resource group in Azure for the managed disk | `ws2025-image-rg` |
| `$VhdDownloadPath` | Local path to save the VHD | `C:\VHDs\WS2025-datacenter.vhd` |
| `$AdminArmEndpoint` | Azure Stack Hub admin ARM endpoint | `https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external` |
| `$TenantID` | Azure AD tenant ID | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `$HubLocation` | Azure Stack Hub region name | `local` |
| `$StorageEndpointDnsSuffix` | External domain suffix | `local.azurestack.external` |
| `$ServiceAdminUserName` | Service admin UPN | `admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com` |
| `$HubResourceGroup` | Resource group on the Hub for storage | `ws2025-image-rg` |
| `$HubStorageAccountName` | Storage account name on the Hub | `ws2025vhds` |

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
.\Example_WS2025-create-image-from-Azure.ps1
```

The script will prompt for the service admin password interactively.

**Optional switches:**

| Switch | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-CleanAzModules` | Uninstalls every existing `Az.*` / `Azs.*` / `Azure*` PowerShell module before installing the hybrid profile. **Off by default** because this affects every PowerShell session on the workstation, not just this script. Use only when you need a clean reinstall. |
| `-ClearAzCliAccount` | Runs `az account clear` before login, removing all cached Azure CLI sessions on the machine. **Off by default.** |
| `-AzureLocation <region>` | Public-Azure region used to create the temporary managed disk. Defaults to `eastus`. |

## VM Licensing & Billing (ARM `LicenseType`)

This section covers **billing**: how Microsoft meters and charges for the Windows Server VM. It is controlled by the `LicenseType` ARM property on the VM resource, set **per-VM** at deployment time (and changeable later with stop/deallocate + `Update-AzVM`). It is **not** part of the platform image.

> **Note:** Azure Stack Hub is considered **on-premises hardware** for licensing purposes. Azure Hybrid Use Benefit (AHUB) is **not required** to use your own Windows Server licenses on Azure Stack Hub (see the [Azure Stack Hub Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2273601&clcid=0x409) FAQ).

### Pay-as-you-use billing model

In the pay-as-you-use model, Azure Stack Hub meters each VM and reports usage to Azure Commerce. The `LicenseType` property controls which meter is used:

| `LicenseType` value | Meter used | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| *Not set* (default) | **Windows Server VM meter** — Windows license cost is included in the per-vCPU/min rate. | You do not have your own Windows Server licenses. |
| `"Windows_Server"` | **Base VM meter** only — lower rate, no Windows license cost included. | You are bringing your own on-premises Windows Server licenses covering all physical cores in the Azure Stack Hub region. |

**Default (Windows Server PAYG VM meter):**

```powershell
# No LicenseType — Windows license included in billing
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -Name "myVM" `
    -Image "MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2025-Datacenter:latest" `
    -Location "local" `
    -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

**Using your own Windows Server license (Base VM meter):**

```powershell
# LicenseType = "Windows_Server" — bring your own license, billed at Base VM rate
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -Name "myVM" `
    -Image "MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2025-Datacenter:latest" `
    -LicenseType "Windows_Server" `
    -Location "local" `
    -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

**ARM Template (under `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` properties):**

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
  "properties": {
    "licenseType": "Windows_Server",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Update an existing VM:**

```powershell
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -Name "myVM"
$vm.LicenseType = "Windows_Server"
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -VM $vm
```

> **Important:** When bringing your own Windows Server licenses, you must have enough Windows Server core licenses to cover **all physical cores** in the Azure Stack Hub region, regardless of how many Windows Server VMs are actually deployed. All cores must be covered with the **same edition** — all Datacenter **or** all Standard — because a VM can be scheduled on any node in the region (Datacenter is recommended for heavily virtualised workloads). Volume Licensing customers must also hold sufficient **Windows Server CALs** for the use case.

### Capacity billing model

In the capacity model, Windows Server guest licenses are **not included** in the annual per-core subscription fee. You must have separate Windows Server Volume Licensing (VL) licenses covering all physical cores in the Azure Stack Hub region. The `LicenseType` property has no billing effect in this model since usage is not reported to Azure Commerce.

For official information, refer to the [Azure Stack Hub Licensing, Packaging & Pricing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2273601&clcid=0x409).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`LicenseType` (billing) and KMS (activation) are two separate, independent concerns.**
>
> - `LicenseType` controls **billing** — which meter Azure Commerce uses for the VM.
> - **KMS** controls **activation** — how the guest OS proves it is genuine.
>
> A VM can be PAYG-billed and KMS-activated, **or** BYOL-billed and KMS-activated. The activation method does not change the meter, and the meter does not change activation. They never need to "match".

## Guest OS Activation (KMS)

This section covers **guest OS activation**: how the Windows Server 2025 guest OS proves it is genuine. Activation lives **inside the guest OS**, completely outside ARM. It has **no** effect on billing, does not talk to ARM, and does not read `LicenseType`.

**KMS activation is required** for Windows Server 2025 guest VMs on Azure Stack Hub:

- **AVMA** (Automatic Virtual Machine Activation) is **not supported** for Windows Server 2025 guests on Azure Stack Hub.
- The **Azure-hosted KMS endpoints** used by public Azure marketplace images are not reachable/applicable on Hub.
- **MAK** keys can be used but are typically reserved for one-off / disconnected scenarios.

Ensure your environment has access to a reachable **KMS host** (e.g., an on-premises KMS server) so that WS2025 VMs can activate after deployment.

### Billing and activation are independent — supported combinations

Any supported activation method works with **either** billing model. The activation host (KMS / MAK) does not query ARM and has no knowledge of `LicenseType`; the Azure Commerce meter has no knowledge of how the OS activated. Pick the billing model and activation method **independently**, based on what you have available:

| `LicenseType` (billing) | Activation method | Supported on Hub? | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| *unset* — **PAYG** (Windows Server VM meter) | **On-prem KMS** | ✅ Yes | **Most common** — Windows licence is in the meter; on-prem KMS handles the activation handshake. No region-wide licensing obligation. |
| *unset* — **PAYG** | **MAK** | ✅ Yes | Works, but uses up a MAK activation count for no commercial benefit; rarely the right choice. |
| *unset* — **PAYG** | **AVMA** | ❌ No | AVMA is not supported for WS2025 guests on Hub. |
| *unset* — **PAYG** | **Azure-hosted KMS** | ❌ No | Public-Azure KMS endpoints are not reachable from Hub. |
| `Windows_Server` — **BYOL** (Base VM meter) | **On-prem KMS** | ✅ Yes | Standard BYOL pattern; requires region-wide WS Datacenter/Standard licensing (all physical cores, same edition). |
| `Windows_Server` — **BYOL** | **MAK** | ✅ Yes | Useful for disconnected or one-off scenarios. |
| `Windows_Server` — **BYOL** | **AVMA** | ❌ No | AVMA is not supported for WS2025 guests on Hub. |

> **Key point:** "PAYG with on-prem KMS" is a **fully supported, normal configuration** — and it is the right default for tenants who do not want to commit to BYOL's all-physical-cores licensing obligation. Activating via KMS does **not** make the VM "BYOL", and it does **not** mean you are double-paying. Under PAYG, the Windows Server licence entitlement is provided by the meter you are paying; KMS is only the technical handshake that confirms the OS is genuine.

> **Important — KMS is activation, not licensing:** Using KMS to activate Windows Server 2025 VMs does **not** remove or bypass any licensing obligation you have for Windows Server. KMS is only an **activation mechanism** — it confirms the OS is genuine and enables full functionality, but it does not grant a licence entitlement. The licensing obligation depends on your billing model:
>
> - **PAYG** (`LicenseType` unset, Windows Server VM meter) — the Windows Server licence is included in the per-vCPU meter; no separate Windows Server licences are required.
> - **BYOL** (`LicenseType="Windows_Server"`, Base VM meter) — you must hold valid Windows Server licences (e.g., Datacenter or Standard) covering **every physical core** in the Azure Stack Hub region, per the [Hub Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2273601&clcid=0x409).
> - **Capacity model** — Windows Server guest licences are **not** included in the capacity fee; separate Volume Licensing covering every physical core is required.
>
> KMS activation succeeding does not, on its own, prove you are correctly licensed under any of these models.

### Common conflations between billing and activation

These two axes are frequently mixed up. The table below maps the symptom to the actual cause and the (incorrect) conclusion that often follows:

| Symptom | Real cause | Category | Wrong conclusion |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS2025 VM won't activate after deploy | No KMS host reachable | Activation | "BYOL is broken on Hub" |
| Bill shows full Windows VM rate despite owning licences | Forgot `LicenseType=Windows_Server` | Billing | "PAYG and BYOL can't mix" |
| Marketplace image deployed on Hub doesn't auto-activate | Azure KMS endpoint not present on Hub | Activation | "The PAYG image is incompatible with BYOL" |
| `LicenseType` flipped but bill unchanged for a day | Usage meters batch / VM still running old state | Billing | "Mixing modes confuses the meter" |

None of these are "PAYG vs BYOL can't coexist" — they are either an **activation** problem or a **`LicenseType` configuration** problem.

## Notes

- The script downloads **AzCopy v10** automatically — no manual installation needed.
- Only **Gen1** (non-Gen2) images are selected, as Azure Stack Hub requires Gen1 VHDs.
- After the image is registered, it appears in the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace and can be used by tenant subscriptions to create VMs.
- To clean up the temporary Azure resources after the VHD is downloaded, delete the resource group specified in `$AzureResourceGroup`.
